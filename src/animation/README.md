README 

	This utility is meant to help you incorporate animation into your project. 

The application is run within the Main package and is run with the main class. Upon running the main class a selection screen should appear that allows you to browse all the files in your computer. Use this screen to select the sprite sheet you would like to use for animation. A sprite sheet is a single image that contains the character or sprite of interest in multiple position that when flashed through quickly look like movement. 

Once a sprite sheet is selected, you should click OK and be taken to the main screen. Here you will see your sprite sheet in the center, control buttons on the right, and an animation name and a duration slider on the left. As frames are added, these will also pop up as buttons on the left. These buttons can be clicked to view and edit the frame characteristics, such as height, width, and x/y position. The duration slider controls the length of the animation with smaller numbers meaning a faster animation because it will last less time. When a frame is set, a red number should appear within the frame in the top left corner indicating the frame's number and thus order of appearance within the animation. After creating several frames, preview the animation with the 'Preview Animation' button. A text field in the top left corner will indicate if the animation is saved or not. Use the 'Save Button' to save the current frames for the current animation. 
 
***Note:*** 
Most sprite sheets contain a background. We have accounted for this by including an activate transparency button. When this button is pressed,the cursor changes to indicate this change transparency state. While this mode is activated, any color that is equal to the pixel pressed/clicked by the cursor until another color is encountered will disappear and become transparent. Multiple clicks will remove the background or any other features you wish to become transparent in your image. This feature can be used on any image you choose to import. Just click the save image button to save this new altered image.
